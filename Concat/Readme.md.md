## Concat

**Concat** is a social media platform to meet new friend groups by matching students by interests and giving them tasks to do like playing online games together, drawing faces using condiments and more! The shared objective bonds students together and creates a lasting connection that other social media applications like Facebook Groups don't do.

Using a human-centered design approach, where we synthesized the "pain-points" of first-year students dealing with the lack of person-to-person connections during COVID, we identified opportunities to improve existing social media apps. Students wanted an app to develop meaningful and long-lasting connections. We designed Concat with these insights in mind.

Our team designed/wireframed the application using Figma. I then created a functional prototype using Swift to show the practicality of the idea as well as the minor details of how our app would be designed!

Concat was chosen by professors and students as one of the **top 4 ideas** in the Designathon competition!
