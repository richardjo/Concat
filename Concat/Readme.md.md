## Concat

**Concat** is a social media platform to meet new friends groups by matching students by interests and giving them tasks to do like playing video games togethe


My friends and I participated in Northwestern's Designathon, a campus-wide competition to design ways to connect students during COVID.  
  
Exciting news: we were within the top 4 teams in a competition that included 41 teams and we won our pod of 9 teams!  
  
Using a human-centered design approach, where we synthesized the "pain-points" of first-year students dealing with the lack of person-to-person connections during COVID, we identified opportunities to improve existing social media apps. Students wanted an app to develop meaningful and long-lasting connections.  
  
With these insights, we designed Concat, a social media platform to meet new friend groups by matching students by interests and giving them tasks to do. Throughout the competition, I worked with students to gather research and design/wireframe the application. I then created a functional prototype using Swift.
