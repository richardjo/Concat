## Concat

**Concat** is a social media platform to meet new friends groups by matching students by interests and giving them tasks to do like playing online games together, drawing faces using condiments and more!

Using a human-centered design approach, where we synthesized the "pain-points" of first-year students dealing with the lack of person-to-person connections during COVID, we identified opportunities to improve existing social media apps. Students wanted an app to develop meaningful and long-lasting connections.  
  
With these insights, we designed an application, a social media platform to meet new friend groups by matching students by interests and giving them tasks to do. Throughout the competition, I worked with students to gather research and design/wireframe the application. I then created a functional prototype using Swift.
